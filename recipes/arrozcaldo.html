        <h2>Arroz Caldo literally means warm rice.</h2>
        <p>This congee that closely resembles risotto has been a favorite Filipino snack. 
            What goes with arroz caldo? I enjoy pairing it with tokwat baboy, which is a 
            combination of boiled pork slices and fried tofu soaked in a vinegar mixture.

            Although arroz caldo is of Chinese origin, the name was actually given by the Spaniards because of pronunciation issues.
